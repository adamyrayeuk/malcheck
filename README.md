# Malcheck
Malcheck is a REST API-based tool that aims to check if there is malware in a file. This tool is implemented using the help of [Yara](https://github.com/VirusTotal/yara) and also uses a collection of rules that can be seen at [Yara-Rules](https://github.com/Yara-Rules/rules).

Malcheck itself is built using the [Spring framework](https://spring.io/) version 3.X framework which is documented using [Swagger](https://swagger.io/).
